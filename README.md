# In-air Hand Gesture Signature - Motion History Image - Blocks (iHGS-MHI-BLOCKS)
Implementation of Custom Image Processing Algorithm For 3D Features Generation

## Abstract
This custom image processing algorithm standardizes and preserves the full sequence of in-air hand gesture signatures. It processes 2000 samples across 100 classes, representing 100 individuals, ensuring the complete preservation of information within 10 frames using MHI and a specialized image processing technique. Each sample, with dimensions 640 x 480 x N, varies in frame count (N). This algorithm uniquely standardizes these varying frame counts, encapsulating all spatio-temporal information within a concise 10-frame format.
